            <p class="firstp">Google dorking refers to the application of search 
            strings that use advanced search operators to find information that 
            is not easily accessible on the internet. Such information could be 
            in form of text, images, classified information, email addresses, 
            passwords, and so on. Often, the information has been left exposed 
            on the internet accidentally.
            Google hacking was introduced by cybersecurity expert Johnny Long.
            In 2002, Long started gathering search queries that could locate and 
            explore vulnerable servers on the internet. These queries could also 
            find the servers that used no security and left sensitive information 
            like email addresses and credit card numbers lying unprotected on them. 
            He later arranged these queries and uploaded them on a website that 
            became the first Google Hacking database in 2004.
            Usually, when you type a keyword into the search bar on Google, 
            it returns results based on all the information it can find on that 
            keyword. These results usually cover a large ground and are unrefined,
            which is what makes Google such a great search engine in the first place.
            When dorking, you need to narrow down the results to the exact 
            information you’re looking for or it will be lost in the sea of 
            the other results. This is where Advanced Google Operators come in.
            Advanced Google Operators narrow down the results to give you the exact 
            information you searched for. They refine the results so you don’t 
            have to go from page to page looking for what you need. </p>

            Teaming is a practice in cybersecurity aimed at simulating real-life cyberattacks
            on a company’s system, network, or workforce. The idea is to determine the
            impenetrability of the company’s defense against cyber threats. There are two
            types of teaming in cybersecurity: blue teaming and red teaming.
            This guide will focus on red teaming and how it differs from penetration testing.
            A blue team comprises individuals in the internal security team of an organization
            that defends it against real-life attackers and the red team.
            Cybersecurity solutions typically defend against a wide array of cyberattacks.
            But the job of the blue team is to spot and neutralize more covert attacks that
            these technologies cannot detect.
            The blue team closely monitors an organization’s system to detect suspicious
            traffic patterns. It also identifies indicators of compromise, which they
            shut down immediately.
            Red Teams are the attacking group, comprised of security experts who
            test the effectiveness of a security infrastructure by mimicking the
            techniques of hackers as realistically as possible.
            Their job is to stealthily try to break the defenses of the company’s
            cybersecurity. They identify and exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses
            while striving to remain undetectable. While a red team can consist of
            individuals that work for the company, the usual practice is to employ
            the services of external cyber experts that will look at the defenses
            with fresh eyes.
            In doing their jobs, the red team employs any means possible that
            a real cyber attacker would to penetrate both the systems and
            physical premises of the company. This could involve creating
            malware and employing social engineering tactics on the employees.
