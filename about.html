<h2>About the Author:</h2>

<p>
    I was born in November 12, 1999 In Grand Rapids Michigan. From there I attended Wealthy elementary,
    EGR Middle school and then finally EGR Highschool. It was In highschool where I found my interest 
    in the world of cybersecurity and how important it is to our daily lives.

    After highschool I attend Grand Rapids Community college. There I didnâ€™t truly know what I 
    wanted to do yet, so I took basic General Ed. courses to meet my requirements to transfer to
    a four year college at some point. Now I attend Michigan State University. I am currently a 
    senior studying Information Science, with a minor in Sales. Here I have really honed in on my 
    curiosity for cyber security and gotten to learn hands on more about the very important field.

<p>
    Some of my favorite things to do to further my knowledge in this field is to...
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Read books</li>
    <li>Watch videos</li>
    <li>Talk to current industry professionals</li>
</ul>
